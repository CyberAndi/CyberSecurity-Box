# Memory Control Example:
# In the example config settings below memory usage is reduced. Some ser-
# vice  levels are lower, notable very large data and a high TCP load are
# no longer supported. Very large data and high TCP loads are exceptional
# for the DNS.  DNSSEC validation is enabled, just add trust anchors.  If
# you do not have to worry about programs using more than 3 Mb of memory,
# the below example is not for you. Use the defaults to receive full ser-
# vice, which on BSD-32bit tops out at 30-40 Mb after heavy usage.



#  # Example settings of Reduced Memory usage:
#  # (To use this 'Reduced Memory' section/config, remove only the
#  # left most, column 1's, one '#'/hash symbol from each line).
#
#  server:

#    outgoing-num-tcp: 1 # this limits TCP service, uses less buffers.
#    incoming-num-tcp: 1
#    outgoing-range: 60  # uses less memory, but less performance.
#    msg-buffer-size: 8192   # note this limits service, 'no huge stuff'.

#  # End of Reduced Memory Usage config.




# Optimise config: 
# Set *-slabs to a power of 2 close to the num-threads value. Do this
# for 'msg-cache-slabs', 'rrset-cache-slabs', 'infra-cache-slabs' and
# 'key-cache-slabs'. This reduces lock contention.
#
# Set the 'outgoing-range' to as large a value as possible, see the
# sections below on how to overcome the limit of 1024 in total. This
# services more clients at a time. With 1 core, try 950. With 2 cores,
# try 450. With 4 cores try 200. The 'num-queries-per-thread' is best set
# at half the number of the 'outgoing-range', but you would like a whole
# lot to be able to soak up a spike in queries. Because of the limit on
# 'outgoing-range' thus also limits 'num-queries-per-thread', it is
# better to compile with libevent (see the section below), so that there
# is no more 1024 limit on 'outgoing-range'.
#
# Here is a short summary of Optimised Config:
#   # (To use this 'Optimised Config' section/config, remove only the

# Birthday Attack protection:
#  Do not allow multiple queries for the same question to be outstanding
# (AKA query chaining). Unbound, Bind, PowerDNS implement this properly.
# Fix recursive nameservers:
#  Port randomization.  Sanitize TTL's.  Use more IP addresses per DNS
#  server.  Harden against bogus size packets.  Harden glue.
#  Additional queries for infrastructure data.  0x20.
# Rebinding protection:
#  Allow to specify IP addresses that may never appear in “external”
#  domain names. This way you can ensure 10.1.1.0/24 would never come in
#  through DNS rebinding. (supported in Unbound and PowerDNS).
# Attack response:
#  At a spoof detection threshold throw away the entire cache and start
#  from scratch.  Prevents using an accepted forged answer.
#  Small value : easy DOS on the cache.
#  Large value : might be too late. (Unbound has spoofmax=10M).
# (PowerDNS has spoofmax=20).
# Chain your caches (esp. the ones behind NAT).
# More NS records : If you already have at least two or three, this does
#  not buy you much. Only makes an attack marginally harder.
#  Excessive NS records cause other problems (and adds more potentially
#  outdated / vulnerable nameservers.
# Hardening infrastructure queries:
#  Before accepting NS records or A records of nameservers, ask at least
#  two different nameservers.
#  Before accepting glue records or additional data, independently
#  verify these with new queries.
#  (extra work is only needed once, then we use caching – minimum impact).
# Double Fast Flux protection: (Draft-bambenek-doubleflux suggests:)
#   Replacing the TTL's of NS and A records of NS records with TTL=72
#   hours. Llimit Registrar changes to once per 72h. Recursors and
#   clients should drop NS or A of NS with TTL < 12.
# Fix recursive nameservers:

#   Answers”.  draft-wijngaards-dnsext-resolver-side-mitigation.
#   draft-vixie-dnsext-0x20.
# Use DNSSEC, What is DNSSEC ?
#   Authenticate (non)existence of data within a zone.
#   Create a path of trust between zones.
#   Sign and preload the root (“.”) key.
#   Add a public key to zone
#   Sign zone with private key
#   Give hash(pubkey) to parent
# The DO bit (query)     DNSSEC (is) OK
# The AD bit (answer)    Authenticated Data
# The CD bit (query)     Checking Disabled
# DNSSEC answers can be:
#   SECURE      Validated with key
#   INSECURE    Validated but no key
#   BOGUS       validation failed
#   UNKNOWN     ServFail etc
# New DNS Record types:
#   DNSKEY    Public key.
#   RRSIG     Signature RRset.
#   NSEC      “Clever” Record,  denial of existence.
#   NSEC3     “Super Clever”, Record stealthy, denial of existence.
#   DS        Delegation Signer r.
# New DNSSEC errors:
#  (almost) none. For maximum compatibility. If any error happens,
#  return the old ServFail.  A validator can then redo the query with
#  the CD bit if it wants to see why it failed.
# NSEC3: denial of existence with a hack:
#  Do not use names, but hashes.  For added work, hash X times.
#  Now sort the hashes.  The validator that gets an NSEC3 record
#  back, hashes the QUERY name (x times) too and compares.
# KSK (Key Signing Key)
#
# DNS servers which redirects: redirection breaks some non-Web
# applications that rely on getting an NXDOMAIN response for
# non-existent domains, such as e-mail spam filtering, or VPN access
# where the private network's nameservers are consulted only when the
# public ones fail to resolve.

	# timeout;  allowing  the  server  time  to  work  on the existing
	# queries. Default depends on compile options, 512 or 1024.

	# queries or high query rates.   Default  200  milliseconds.
	# The effect  is  that the qps for long-lasting queries is about
	# (numqueriesperthread / 2) / (average time  for  such  long  queries)

	# The netblock is given as  an  IP4  or  IP6  address  with  /size
	# appended  for a classless network block. The action can be 'deny',
	# 'refuse', 'allow' or 'allow_snoop'.
	# The action deny stops queries from hosts from that netblock.
	# The action refuse stops queries  too,  but  sends  a  DNS  rcode
	# REFUSED error message back.
	# The action allow gives access to clients from that netblock.  It
	# gives only access for recursion clients (which  is  what  almost
	# all clients need).  Nonrecursive queries are refused.
	# The  allow  action does allow nonrecursive queries to access the
	# local-data that is configured.  The reason is that this does not
	# involve  the  unbound  server  recursive  lookup  algorithm, and
	# static data is served in the reply.  This supports normal opera-
	# tions  where nonrecursive queries are made for the authoritative
	# data.  For nonrecursive queries any  replies  from  the  dynamic
	# cache are refused.
	# The action allow_snoop gives nonrecursive access too.  This give
	# both recursive and non recursive access.  The  name  allow_snoop
	# refers  to  cache  snooping,  a  technique  to  use nonrecursive
	# queries to examine the  cache  contents  (for  malicious  acts).
	# However,  nonrecursive  queries can also be a valuable debugging
	# tool (when you want to examine the cache contents). In that case
	# use allow_snoop for your administration host.
	# By  default only localhost is allowed, the rest is refused.  The
	# default is refused, because that is protocol-friendly.  The  DNS

	# local-zone: <zone> <type>     # [LOCAL ZONE]
	# Configure  a  local zone. The type determines the answer to give
	# if there is no  match  from  local-data.  The  types  are  deny,
	# refuse,  static, transparent, redirect, nodefault, typetranspar-
	# ent, and are explained below. After that  the  default  settings
	# are  listed.  Use local-data: to enter data into the local zone.
	# Answers for  local  zones  are  authoritative  DNS  answers.  By
	# default the zones are class IN.
	#
	# If you need more complicated authoritative data, with referrals,
	# wildcards, CNAME/DNAME support, or DNSSEC authoritative service,
	# setup  a  stub-zone  for it as detailed in the stub zone section
	# below.
	#
	# 'deny' Do not send an answer, drop the query.  If there is  a  match
	#    from local data, the query is answered.
	#
	# 'refuse'
	#    Send an error message reply, with rcode REFUSED.  If there is
	#    a match from local data, the query is answered.
	#
	# 'static'
	#    If there is a match from local data, the query  is  answered.
	#    Otherwise,  the  query  is  answered with nodata or nxdomain.
	#    For a negative answer a SOA is  included  in  the  answer  if
	#    present as local-data for the zone apex domain.
	#
	# 'transparent'
	#    If  there  is a match from local data, the query is answered.
	#    Otherwise if the query has a different  name,  the  query  is
	#    resolved  normally.   If  the  query  is  for a name given in
	#    localdata but no such type of data  is  given  in  localdata,
	#    then  a  noerror nodata answer is returned.  If no local-zone
	#    is given local-data causes a transparent zone to  be  created
	#    by default.
	#
	# 'typetransparent'
	#    If  there  is a match from local data, the query is answered.
	#    If the query is for a different name, or for  the  same  name
	#    but  for  a  different  type, the query is resolved normally.
	#    So, similar to transparent but types that are not  listed  in
	#    local data are resolved normally, so if an A record is in the
	#    local data that does  not  cause  a  nodata  reply  for  AAAA
	#    queries.
	#
	# 'redirect'
	#    The  query is answered from the local data for the zone name.
	#    There may be no local  data  beneath  the  zone  name.   This
	#    answers  queries for the zone, and all subdomains of the zone
	#    with the local data for the zone.  It can be used to redirect
	#    a  domain  to  return  a  different address record to the end
	#    user,   with   local-zone:   "example.com."   redirect    and
	#    local-data:  "example.com. A 127.0.0.1" queries for www.exam-
	#    ple.com and www.foo.example.com are redirected, so that users
	#    with  web  browsers  cannot  access  sites  with suffix exam-
	#    ple.com.
	#
	# 'nodefault'
	#    Used to turn off default contents for AS112 zones. The  other
	#    types also turn off default contents for the zone. The 'node-
	#    fault' option has no other effect than  turning  off  default
	#    contents for the given zone.
	#
	# The default zones are localhost, reverse 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and the
	# AS112 zones. The AS112 zones are reverse DNS zones for private use
	# and reserved IP addresses for which the servers on the internet
	# cannot provide correct answers. They are configured by default to

# uses these clauses to setup SSLv3 / TLSv1 security for the  connection.

# Stub zones.     [STUB ZONES]
# stub-zone: [name: <domain-name>|stub-host: <domain-name>|...
# There may be multiple stub-zone: clauses. Each with a name: and zero or
# more hostnames or IP addresses.  For the stub zone this list  of  name-
# servers  is used. Class IN is assumed.  The servers should be authority
# servers, not  recursors;  unbound  performs  the  recursive  processing
# itself for stub zones.
# The stub zone can be used to configure authoritative data to be used by
# the resolver that cannot be accessed using the public internet servers.
# This  is  useful  for  company-local  data  or  private zones. Setup an
# authoritative server on a different host (or different port).  Enter  a
# config entry for unbound with stub-addr: 
# < ip adrs of host [@port] > (no space in between ip-adrs @ & Port#.)
# The unbound resolver can then access the data, without referring to the
# public internet for it.
# This  setup  allows DNSSEC signed zones to be served by that authorita-
# tive server, in which case a trusted key entry with the public key  can
# be  put in config, so that unbound can validate the data and set the AD
# bit on replies for the private zone (authoritative servers do  not  set
# the AD bit).  This setup makes unbound capable of answering queries for
# the private zone, and can even set the AD bit ('authentic'), but the AA
# ('authoritative') bit is not set on these replies.
#
#  name: <domain name>
#    Name of the stub zone.
#
#  stub-host: <domain name>
#    Name  of  stub  zone nameserver. Is itself resolved before it is
#    used.
#
#  stub-addr: <IP address>
#    IP address of stub zone nameserver. Can be IP 4 or IP 6.  To use
#    a nondefault port for DNS communication append '@' with the port
#    number.
#
#  stub-prime: <yes or no>
#    This option is by default off.  If enabled it  performs  NS  set
#    priming,  which  is similar to root hints, where it starts using
#    the list of nameservers currently published by the zone.   Thus,
#    if  the  hint list is slightly outdated, the resolver picks up a
#    correct list online.
#
#  stub-first: <yes or no>
#    If enabled, a query is attempted without the stub clause  if  it
#    fails.  The default is no.
#
# Create entries like below, to make all queries for 'example.com' and 
# 'example.org' go to the given list of nameservers. list zero or more 
# nameservers by hostname or by ipaddress. If you set stub-prime to yes, 
# the list is treated as priming hints (default is no).
# With stub-first yes, it attempts without the stub if it fails.
# stub-zone:
# 	name: "example.com"
# 	stub-addr: 192.0.2.68
# 	stub-prime: haveno
# 	stub-first: no
# stub-zone:
# 	name: "example.org"
# 	stub-host: ns.example.com.
#
# For Unbound a stub-zone should have authoritative dns/name servers.

# Forward zones     [FORWARD ZONES]
# Options
# There may be multiple forward-zone: clauses. Each with a name: and zero
# or more hostnames or IP addresses.  For the forward zone this  list  of
# nameservers  is  used  to forward the queries to. The servers listed as
# forward-host: and forward-addr: have to handle  further  recursion  for
# the  query.   Thus,  those  servers  are not authority servers, but are
# (just like unbound is) recursive servers too; unbound does not  perform
# recursion itself for the forward zone, it lets the remote server do it.
# Class IN is assumed.  A forward-zone entry with name  "."  and  a  for-
# ward-addr  target will forward all queries to that other server (unless
# it can answer from the cache).
#
#  name: <domain name>
#     Name of the forward zone.
#
#  forward-host: <domain name>
#     Name of server to forward to. Is itself resolved  before  it  is
#     used.
#
#  forward-addr: <IP address>
#     IP address of server to forward to. Can be IP 4 or IP 6.  To use
#     a nondefault port for DNS communication append '@' with the port
#     number.
#
#  forward-first: <yes or no>
#     If  enabled,  a query is attempted without the forward clause if
#     it fails.  The default is no.
#
# Create entries like below, to make all queries for 'example.com' and
# 'example.org' go to the given list of servers. These servers have to
# handle recursion to other nameservers. List zero or more nameservers
# by hostname or by ipaddress. Use an entry with name "." to forward all
# queries. If you enable forward-first, it attempts without the forward
# if it fails.
# forward-zone:
# 	name: "example.com"
# 	forward-addr: 192.0.2.68
# 	forward-addr: 192.0.2.73@5355  # forward to port 5355.
# 	forward-first: no
# forward-zone:
# 	name: "example.org"
# 	forward-host: fwd.example.com
#
# For Unbound, recursive dns/name servers should be added as 
# forward-zone(s).  And add nameservers as stub-zone.

# You have these options/choices:     [ROOT ZONE]
# 1. Disable the below line which has (forward-zone:) above the
#    line which has (name: "." # [Root.Zone]),
#    also disable (name: "." # [Root.Zone]) line itself.
#    And then you will also have to disable all lines below it
#    or remove them on a backup file.  By default,
#    ICANN/IANA/Verisign/etc governed & operated Root DNS Servers
#    are used.
# 2. You may use below two lines which has (forward-zone:)
#    and (name: "." # [Root.Zone]), and then specify only your
#    ISP's recursive or caching DNS srvr IP adrs(s), if they do
#    not filter/censor sites. (Also see ISP section in below).
# 3. You can keep below two lines, which has (forward-zone:)
#    and (name: "." # [Root.Zone]), and then specify such set of
#    recursive or caching DNS/name server's IP address, which does
#    not censor and can also resolve TLDs from "ICANN/IANA/Verisign
#    governed or operated Root DNS Servers".

# Resistant to DNS cache poisoning including "Kaminsky Flaw" attacks as
# well as Denial-of-service attacks.
